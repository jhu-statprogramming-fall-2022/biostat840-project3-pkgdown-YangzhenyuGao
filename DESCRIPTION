Description: This package will test your data for normality using a graphical and a statistical method. 
  As a graphical method, quantile-quantile plots (Q-Q plot) will be constructed in order for you to visualize 
  whether the data closely approximates a straight line - thereby indicating it is normally distributed. As a 
  statistical method, the Shapiro-Wilk test score will be calculated along with the corresponding p-value. The 
  Shapiro-Wilk test provides better power than most other statistical normality tests as long as **most of the 
  values are unique** This package will also derive the parameters that would fit your data to a normal 
  distribution using maximum likelihood estimation.
